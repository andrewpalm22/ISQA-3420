# Executive Summary

### Why is this an Issue?
  This system has been implemented for the main purpose of making certain processes in the company easier and more streamlined. The implementation of this system should overall increase productivity at the company due to the fact that employees are spending
less time taking steps to make things happen, and more time actually being able to work on things and get them done. Implementation 
should also lead to the Developer and Manager being able to work more independently of each other due to the fact that few of their
processes overlap.

### System Capabilities
  One thing this system does is simplify complex/multi-step processes Life is now simpler for the Developer, for example, as they now only have to take one step to check for licenses, vulnerabilities, as well as submit their work to the company database. One example of streamlining would be that the process for the whole company regarding retreiving license & vulnerability information from the License & Vulnerability Database is now the same process whether you are a Developer or Manager. The Developer is able to submit their software to have it checked for licenses & vulnerabilities, then written to the license & vulnerability database. The Developer can also request license & vulnerability information stored in the license & vulnerability database, along with the Manager who has the same capability. The Manager can also submit a project request to be checked against stored policy in the Policy Database. Stored policy in the Policy Database can also be modified by the Manager, or new policy can be written to it by the Manager.
