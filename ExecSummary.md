This system has been implemented for the main purpose of making certain processes in the company easier and more streamlined.
Life is now simple for the Developer, for example, as they now only has to take one step to check for licenses, vulnerabilities, as well as submit their work to the company
database. One example of streamlining would be that the process for the whole company regarding retreiving license & vulnerability
information from the License & Vulnerability Database is now the same process whether you are a Developer or Manager. 

The implementation of this system should overall increase productivity at the company due to the fact that employees are spending
less time taking steps to make things happen, and more time actually being able to work on things and get them done. Implementation 
should also lead to the Developer and Manager being able to work more independently of each other due to the fact that few of their
processes overlap.

This type of system would likely be used in open source communities that like to have greater degrees of independence among its
people/workers, as well as those where manually checking for licenses & vulnerabilities costs too much time to do.
